# This code block specifies the files and directories that should be ignored
# by version control systems such as Git.

# The "node\_modules" directory contains the dependencies of a Node.js project.
# It is typically large and should be ignored by version control systems to
# reduce the size of the repository and avoid conflicts with other developers'
# dependency versions.
node_modules/

# The "package-lock.json" file is automatically generated when installing
# Node.js packages using the "npm" package manager. It contains a versioned
# snapshot of the package dependencies in the current project. It should be
# ignored by version control systems to avoid conflicts with other developers'
# dependency versions.
package-lock.json

# The ".yarn" directory contains the dependencies of a Node.js project that
# are managed by the "Yarn" package manager. It should be ignored by version
# control systems to reduce the size of the repository and avoid conflicts with
# other developers' dependency versions.
.yarn/
